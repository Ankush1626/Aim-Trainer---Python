Aim Trainer Game (Python)
Objective: The goal of the game is to improve your aim by clicking on targets as quickly and accurately as possible before they disappear.

How to Play:

Targets Appear: Red targets will randomly appear on the screen. They start small and grow to a maximum size before shrinking and disappearing.

Click the Targets: Use your mouse to click on the targets before they disappear. Each successful click is a "hit."

Keep Track: At the top of the screen, you'll see your stats:

Time: How long you've been playing.
Speed: How many targets you hit per second.
Hits: Total number of targets you've successfully clicked.
Lives: You start with 3 lives. If you miss a target (it disappears without you hitting it), you lose a life.
Game Over: The game ends when you lose all your lives. You'll see your final stats, including your accuracy (how many targets you hit out of total clicks), and you can quit the game by pressing any key.

Goal: Try to hit as many targets as possible before losing all your lives. Aim for high speed and accuracy to improve your skills!
